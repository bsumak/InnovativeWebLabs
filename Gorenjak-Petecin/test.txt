“Somebody stabbed you in the neck, young lady.”
My eyes widen, and I slowly turn toward the elderly gentleman
standing at my side. He presses the up button on the elevator and faces
me. He smiles and points to my neck.
“Your birthmark,” he says.

My hand instinctively goes up to my neck, and I touch the dime-
sized mark just below my ear.

“My grandfather used to say the placement of a birthmark was the
story of how a person lost the battle in their past life. I guess you got
stabbed in the neck. Bet it was a quick death, though.”
I smile, but I can’t tell if I should be afraid or entertained. Despite his
somewhat morbid opening conversation, he can’t be that dangerous.
His curved posture and shaky stance give away that he isn’t a day less
than eighty years old. He takes a few slow steps toward one of two
velvet red chairs that are positioned against the wall next to the elevator.
He grunts as he sinks into the chair and then looks up at me again.
“You going up to floor eighteen?”
My eyes narrow as I process his question. He somehow knows what
floor I’m going to, even though this is the first time I’ve ever set foot in
this apartment complex, and it’s definitely the first time I’ve ever laid
eyes on this man.

“Yes, sir,” I say cautiously. “Do you work here?”
“I do indeed.”
He nods his head toward the elevator, and my eyes move to the
illuminated numbers overhead. Eleven floors to go before it arrives. I
pray it gets here quickly.
“I push the button for the elevator,” he says. “I don’t think there’s an
official title for my position, but I like to refer to myself as a flight
captain, considering I do send people as high as twenty stories up in the
air.”
I smile at his words, since my brother and father are both pilots.
“How long have you been flight captain of this elevator?” I ask as I wait.
I swear this is the slowest damn elevator I’ve ever encountered.
“Since I got too old to do maintenance on this building. Worked
here thirty-two years before I became captain. Been sending people on
flights now for more than fifteen years, I think. Owner gave me a pity
job to keep me busy till I died.” He smiles to himself. “What he didn’t
realize is that God gave me a lot of great things to accomplish in my
life, and right now, I’m so far behind I ain’t ever gonna die.”
I find myself laughing when the elevator doors finally open. I reach
down to grab the handle of my suitcase and turn to him one more time
before I step inside. “What’s your name?”
“Samuel, but call me Cap,” he says. “Everybody else does.”
“You got any birthmarks, Cap?”
He grins. “As a matter of fact, I do. Seems in my past life, I was shot
right in the ass. Must have bled out.”
I smile and bring my hand to my forehead, giving him a proper
captain’s salute. I step into the elevator and turn around to face the open
doors, admiring the extravagance of the lobby. This place seems more

like a historic hotel than an apartment complex, with its expansive
columns and marble floors.
When Corbin said I could stay with him until I found a job, I had no
idea he lived like an actual adult. I thought it would be similar to the last
time I visited him, right after I graduated from high school, back when
he had first started working toward his pilot’s license. That was four
years and a two-story sketchy complex ago. That’s kind of what I was
expecting.
I certainly wasn’t anticipating a high-rise smack dab in the middle of
downtown San Francisco.
I find the panel and press the button for the eighteenth floor, then
look up at the mirrored wall of the elevator. I spent all day yesterday
and most of this morning packing up everything I own from my
apartment back in San Diego. Luckily, I don’t own much. But after
making the solo five-hundred-mile drive today, my exhaustion is pretty
evident in my reflection. My hair is in a loose knot on top of my head,
secured with a pencil, since I couldn’t find a hair tie while I was driving.
My eyes are usually as brown as my hazelnut hair, but right now, they
look ten shades darker, thanks to the bags under them.
I reach into my purse to find a tube of ChapStick, hoping to salvage
my lips before they end up as weary-looking as the rest of me. As soon
as the elevator doors begin to close, they open again. A guy is rushing
toward the elevators, preparing to walk on as he acknowledges the old
man. “Thanks, Cap,” he says.
I can’t see Cap from inside the elevator, but I hear him grunt
something in return. He doesn’t sound nearly as eager to make small
talk with this guy as he was with me. This man looks to be in his late
twenties at most. He grins at me, and I know exactly what’s going
through his mind, considering he just slid his left hand into his pocket.
